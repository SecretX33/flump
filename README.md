A customized version of Flump for World of Warcraft 3.3.5a

The original version of Flump can be found here http://wow.curseforge.com/addons/flump/

I stumbled upon this addon when looking for a simple addon to detect the activation of spells like Aura Mastery
and found this addon to be quite useful and lightweight, but there were a few short comings and since the project
was marked as abandoned I made a fork of it from the v3.3.5 release in curseforge for personal purposes.

Changes made in this customized version

1. Many of the spells are disabled by default, only spells with over 2 minute cooldown are set to display by default
2. The default output is "SAY" instead of "RAID" to reduce the text clutter present in RAID chat
3. Added a couple of spells "Hymn of Hope" and "Mana Tide Totem" to the list of spells available
