A customized version of Flump for World of Warcraft 3.3.5a

The original version of Flump can be found here http://wow.curseforge.com/addons/flump/

(fraggerfox) I stumbled upon this addon when looking for a simple addon to detect the activation of spells like Aura Mastery
and found this addon to be quite useful and lightweight, but there were a few short comings and since the project
was marked as abandoned I made a fork of it from the v3.3.5 release in curseforge for personal purposes.

(secretx33) Same as fraggerfox, I found this addon quite lightweight, simple and easy to edit, but I wanted to improve it, that's why I am forking his customized version to improve it even more and add more features. The code itself need to be cleaned, it's actually working, but it's also too messy and too hard to switch on/off spell announces.

Note: All credits go to the original author of Flump.

What is even with fraggerfox's customized version?

* Added a couple of spells "Hymn of Hope" and "Mana Tide Totem" to the list of spells available

What is more or less even with fraggerfox's customized version?

* (CHANGED SOME SPELLS) Many of the spells are disabled by default, only spells with over 2 minute cooldown are set to display by default

What is different from fraggerfox's customized version?

* I've changed back from "SAY" to "RAID" because using SAY within a raid is bae
* Added Hunter's Misdirection ability to the list of spells available

To-Do 

1. Make code cleaner and easy to switch spell announces
2. Add a verification to prevent multiple announcements for the same spell (aka multiple people using this addon)
3. Add more spells, maybe?
